title: "Reading List"
draft: false
---
This counts as a TBR, except that it's not just books, papers, and articles I will be listing down here. There are also movies, TV shows, and other forms of content I think are worth putting on the list.

# Academic
The following might seem ambitious, but keep in mind that I have no time horizon in mind for when I desire to finish what's on the list. These are (extremely) long-term goals.

## Papers

## Textbooks
- Math
	- Axler - Linear Algebra Done Right
	  I've been slowly working my way through the book for a couple of months now. In my initial read, I would internalize the theorems without really worrying about the proofs, just to get to a point where I could understand why so many definitions and theorems are being stated. Once I finished the chapter on inner product spaces, I felt I had enough context, and have since started from the top again, but in painstaking detail this time. I try and give each page 20-30 minutes at minimum.
	- Larsen and Marx - An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and its Applications
	  I first tried reading through Casella and Berger, but the lack of applications was a hurdle. I do plan on getting to C&B eventually, but I wanted something that would help me build up some working proficiency in statistical inference first.
	- Bertsekas - Convex Optimization Theory
	  I plan on reading this as a precursor to Beck's and Nesterov's books.
	- Stein - Real Analysis
	  The motivation here is pretty simple. I want to understand measure theory in more depth than I currently do. This book is likely much more rigorous than the next one in the list, but I plan on reading both.
	- Tao - An Introduction to Measure Theory
	- Keener - Theoretical Statistics
	- Boucheron, Lugosi, and Massart - Concentration Inequalities
	- Wainwright - High Dimensional Statistics
	  If I remember correctly, all of the last three books are references for Michael I Jordan's statistics courses at Berkeley, which I think is reason enough to give them a read. 
- Machine Learning
	- Blum, Hopcroft, and Kannan - Foundations of Data Science
	  I've liked everything I've read so far. The book is certainly not undergraduate level, and doesn't spoon-feed its ideas to you, but it also isn't dry or terse. Hope to finish this by the end of the year, it'll hopefully catch me up enough to where I can start reading both Blum's and Kannan's papers.
	- Mohri - Foundations of Machine Learning
	  The standard, from what I can tell. I should read it, if for no other reason than to have a solid grasp on learning theory.
