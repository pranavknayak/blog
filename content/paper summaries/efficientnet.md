title: "EfficientNet: A Summary"
draft: false
---
I just finished reading the EfficientNet paper, and I think I have a decent idea of what it's trying to do. I'll give it a couple of days' break, give it one final read (the third pass of your standard 3-pass framework), and then write out my thoughts. It's a very simple paper, so the summary shouldn't be super long. I'll be writing out my summary along the lines of Michael Mitzenmacher's [reviewing advice](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/CS222/ReadPaper.pdf).
