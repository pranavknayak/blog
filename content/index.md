title:  fuji's research notes 
draft: false

Hello! I'm Pranav. I go by fuji online, and I'm someone who's very interested in the mathematics and theory that underlies machine learning. I am particularly passionate about understanding where *deep* learning fails to adhere to the established theory, and about ways to go about filling that gap.

This blog is supposed to be a research journal of sorts, detailing my thoughts about whatever field I am currently studying, as well as specific approaches I am pursuing in any ongoing research projects.

I plan to use this as a knowledge repository of sorts. It should, eventually, contain everything I know about everything related to math, ml, dl, and all other related fields.

To see what I am currently working on, check out the [[current work]] page. For past work, check out the [[past work]] page. Feel free to reach out to discuss anything that's on either of the two!
