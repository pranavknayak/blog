## Textbooks
Everything I've heard and all the talks I've listened to kind of hinted that if I want to contribute seriously to ML Theory, I would have to come into the field with a foundational perspective. With that in mind, I am currently focusing on making sure that my grounding in statistics, and in computational complexity, are both bulletproof. Here are the books I'm using to achieve that:

-  Statistical Inference - Casella & Berger
	- Probability Theory (Notes for STAT310) - Amir Dembo (once I've finished the above).
- Mathematics and Computation - Avi Wigderson

Also, I am interspersing my studies in these fundamentals with studies in learning theory, so that I don't lose touch with the end goal:
-  Learning Theory from First Principles - Francis Bach

## Projects
- Transformer Compositionality - working with Prof. [Konda Reddy Mopuri](https://krmopuri.github.io/) and Prof. [Sumohana Channappayya](https://people.iith.ac.in/sumohana/) on understanding how representations compose from primitives in transformers.
- Quantum Software Static Analysis - working with Prof. [M. V. Panduranga Rao](https://people.iith.ac.in/mvp/) and Prof. [Lei Zhang](https://informationsystems.umbc.edu/home/faculty-and-staff/new-faculty-spotlights/lei-zhang-2/) to design a tool for pattern detection in quantum software.

## Reading

### Fiction
I've finished *Priory*, and have moved on to Mistborn. I've already read through the first trilogy before, but that was years ago, so I'm planning on giving the entire series (7 books + novellas) a read, and have started with *The Final Empire*.
### Non-fiction
I'm working through Ha-Joon Chang's *Economics: The User's Guide*. I've had a bunch of false starts with the book before, but I'm hoping that this time I actually manage to power through to the end.

For a log of what I *plan* on studying, check out my [[reading list]].
